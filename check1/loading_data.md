# Loading Data


## Correcting Assignment 2
On assignment 2 I was confused about a thing and did a thing wrong.

First I had a typo
```{code-cell} ipython3
import panda as pd
```

Now I know that the correct name is `pandas`
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

That cost me a lot of time but I also wrote psuedo code anyway, it wasn't right though since I couldn't see the output

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that ran but produce the wrong output
```

this should have been this way instead


```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that is fixed
```

I learned that this method works by doing some steps, here is a way we can see about that functionality

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that demos a feature or inspects a value
```

## Other ways of loading data

Another thing we can do loading data is something, that looks like this


```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code
```

this would be good for these situations, but a risk of doign that is something, we can see that by

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that does a bad thing
```

and then we investigate


```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that shows why that's bad
```

This is especially good when something is true beacuse it's faster

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
# one way  code
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
# other way code
```
