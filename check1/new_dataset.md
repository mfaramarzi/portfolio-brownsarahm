# Building a New Dataset

I would like to study if x and y are related, but I couldn't find a dataset about both. I found a dataset about x that included w and a dataset about y that included z. I can compute v from w and v from z.

## Getting the data together

First let's get all fo the data loaded into python

### Loading and cleaning X
First let's exmaine the data about x

```{code-cell} ipython3
# load data x
```

It has some problems:
 - problem 1
 - problem 2
 - problem 3

First I'll fix problem 2 because that will make fixin 1 & 3 easier

The plan to fix is this high level idea
```{code-cell} ipython3
# comment on step 1

# second step comment

```

next


```{code-cell} ipython3
# more code
```


### loading and cleaning y

what i'm going to do

```{code-cell} ipython3
# more code
```

observation.

next plan
```{code-cell} ipython3
# more code
```
 observation


## Making them compatible

### computing v from w


### computing v from z


## Merging

I'll use this type of merge because ...
