# My Cool Analysis


I am interested in the relationship between x and y and in [the previous chapter](new_dataset) I built a dataset to study this.

## Getting ready

Some steps
```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that load data
```


## Keyword

First I'll answer this question related to Keyword

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that uses summary stats like level 3 describes
```

interpretation. more questions


```{code-cell} ipython3
#  more code
```

more interpretation


## Another keyword

Next I'll address: another question?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that plots using new parameters from seaborn
```

evaluation of plot, it has this weakness.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  code that makes the plot better using matplotlib to customize it
```

interpretation of insights from the plot
